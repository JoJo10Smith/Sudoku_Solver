# Sudoku_Solver
V1 ==> 05/07/2020
I have attepted to create a sudoku solving algorithm based on the back-tracking algorithm and heuristics which can be found here:
https://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~sandiway/sudoku/index.html#heuristics

I have succcesfully completed a few puzzles but have yet to write an algorithm that can solve more complicated puzzles that require a bit more intuition
